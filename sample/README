INFO

  Works with java reflections to create a database of products, saved in memory as a hash table of arrays and to disk as a sqlite file. Valid products are any class that inherits from Product.class in the project's folder. These class files may be dropped-in while the program is running. In-memory, a user owns an array of products which are guaranteed to have unique names.

  The in-memory datastructure:
    UserName1 => [Product1, Product2, Product3]
    UserName2 => [Product1, Product2, ProductN]

  Each time a product's attribute is entered, a default value is saved for attributes of that name for that user, and following attributes will default to the saved value on command.
