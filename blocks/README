USAGE
  ./blocks.pl [ --term=<str>|--match|--no-match|--data=<str>|--delim=<str> LOCAL_FILE ]

DESCRIPTION
  Use to parse files composed of regular blocks of text

  --match     -m  : Match the term
  --no-match -nom : Match all but the term; inverted match
  --delim     -de : Delimit the blocks of text by this header line (REQUIRED)
                       delimiter header line is included in the block

EXAMPLES
  We are looking at a log file of computers identified by their ip addresses
  It might look like this:

    IP-ADDRESS 10.10.10.10
    OS: xp
    VULNS: Isn't running free software
    IP-ADDRESS 42.42.42.42
    OS: linux
    VULNS: None
    IP-ADDRESS 1.2.3.4
    OS: mac
    VULNS: High risk of social engineering through confident users

  Each computer has its operating system defined, xp, vista, ubuntu
  Each computer has a list of secuirty holes like: VULNS: Default SSH Port, No pass


  We want to list the security holes of computers that aren't running xp

  ./blocks.pl --term xp --no-match --delim IP-ADDRESS --data 'VULNS:(.*)'
    None
    High risk of social engineering through confident users


  We want to list the blocks of text associated with computers that aren't running xp

  ./blocks.pl --term xp --no-match --delim IP-ADDRESS trialfile
    IP-ADDRESS 42.42.42.42
    OS: linux
    VULNS: None
    IP-ADDRESS 1.2.3.4
    OS: mac
    VULNS: High risk of social engineering through confident users

    
  We want to list the ips from each block of text

  ./blocks.pl --delim IP-ADDRESS --data 'IP-ADDRESS (.*)' trialfile
    10.10.10.10
    42.42.42.42
    1.2.3.4
